# gfg_Problem_Statement
project 1: Swiggy Data Analysis :
Swiggy, a leading food delivery platform, generates a massive volume of data on a daily basis. Extracting valuable insights from this data and optimizing operational processes are crucial for its success. One effective approach to achieve this is by leveraging the power of the Pandas library in Python. In this analysis, we'll explore how Pandas can be utilized to create new DataFrames, conduct data evaluation, and perform insightful analyses.

Project 2: GeeksofGeeks Data Analysis:
Utilizing web scraping techniques in @main.py file , specifically with the library "requests_html", we can gather data from GeeksforGeeks' YouTube channel spanning six months. The "HTMLSession" library facilitates fetching the data. With the acquired data in hand, we can employ Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. Tasks such as calculating view trends over time, identifying popular video categories, and assessing viewer engagement through likes and comments can be executed. This approach aids in deriving actionable insights from the YouTube data, enabling GeeksforGeeks to optimize content strategy, enhance user engagement, and make informed decisions based on the analysis results.
